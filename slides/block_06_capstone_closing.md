# Designing Analytics Projects

## Block 6: Capstone Preparation & Closing

**Eduardo Arino de la Rubia**
January 12, 2026

---

## Block 6 Overview

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| Capstone Lifecycle Overview | 25 min |
| Finding & Securing Projects | 25 min |
| Your Assignment: Scenario → Brief | 25 min |
| Closing | 25 min |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the final block of the course. Energy may be lower after a full day. The content is practical (capstone preparation) and motivational (closing). Pace appropriately — not too slow, but allow for reflection.

**Key point:** Everything we've covered leads to the capstone. This block makes that connection explicit.

**Say something like:**
"This is our final block. We're covering four things: the capstone lifecycle so you know what's coming, how to find and secure projects, your assignment that's due Thursday, and then we'll close out the course.

This block is practical. It's about your capstone — the biggest single deliverable in your program. Everything we've covered over the past two days is meant to help you scope that project well."

**Energy check:** This is late in Day 2. If energy seems low, consider starting with a quick stand-up stretch or a brief energizer question.

**Transition:** "Let me start by framing why this matters..."
-->

---

## Why This Matters

Everything in this course points toward one thing:

**Your capstone project.**

This is the largest single deliverable in your program. It's what employers see. It's what you talk about in interviews.

The Analytics Project Brief is your tool to **scope it professionally**.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students may not yet appreciate how important the capstone is for their careers. It's the main portfolio piece they'll reference in job interviews. Employers care about it. Poor scoping leads to poor capstones leads to weak interview stories.

**Key point:** The capstone is career-relevant. Good scoping = good capstone = good interview stories.

**Say something like:**
"Everything in this course points toward one thing: your capstone project.

This isn't just an academic exercise. The capstone is the largest single deliverable in your program. It's what employers see when they review your CV. It's what you'll talk about in interviews for years.

I can tell you from experience as a hiring manager: capstone projects matter. When I interview someone, I ask about their biggest analytical project. The people who can explain it clearly — the problem, the approach, the impact, the challenges — stand out. The people who mumble through a vague description of 'some analysis I did' don't get hired.

The Brief is your tool to scope the capstone professionally. Good scoping leads to good execution leads to good stories in interviews."

**Transition:** "Let me walk you through the capstone timeline..."

# Part 1: Capstone Lifecycle Overview
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The Capstone Timeline: Finding Phase

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| ~~Mid-October~~ | ~~Start looking for clients~~ |
| ~~Mid-November~~ | ~~Report potential projects~~ |
| **Dec – Feb** | Matchmaking ← **you are here** |
| **March 16** | Assigned to project |

---

## The Capstone Timeline: Execution Phase

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **March 30** | Submit PID |
| **April 10** | Project officially begins |
| **May 11** | Interim progress report |
| **June 8** | Final deliverables due |
| **June 10-12** | Final Exam |

**Key insight:** The hardest part isn't execution. It's finding and scoping.

---

## The Three Deliverables

**1. Project Presentation** (10-20 slides)
Problem, solution, and recommendations for your sponsor.

**2. Technical Discussion** (20-25 pages)
Complete consulting-style report with methodology details.

**3. Public Summary** (3 pages)
General audience essay for the ETD database.

All three require a **well-scoped project**. The Brief is your scoping tool.

---

## How the Brief Scaffolds Your Capstone

Each Brief section maps to a capstone question:

- **Problem & Decision** → What question are you answering?
- **Metrics** → How will you measure success?
- **Stakeholders** → Who is your sponsor?
- **Methodology** → What analyses will you run?
- **Scope** → What's in and out?

---

## Building Your Brief Over Time

**You'll practice Brief concepts through weekly write-ups (Feb 10 – Mar 17).**

First you'll practice concepts while searching for projects, then build Brief sections once assigned.

---

## What Makes a Good Capstone Project?

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Real business question** | Shows you can work on actual problems |
| **Access to data** | You can't analyze what you can't see |
| **Engaged sponsor** | Someone who cares about the answer |
| **Feasible scope** | Completable in the time available |
| **Demonstrable impact** | You can show what you did mattered |

**Warning signs:** Vague questions, unavailable data, absent sponsors.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This slide establishes the criteria for project selection. Students often accept the first project that comes along. These five criteria help them evaluate whether a project will be successful.

**Key point:** Not all projects are created equal. Learn to say no to bad projects.

**Say something like:**
"Let me tell you what makes a good capstone project.

Real business question: Not 'explore the data' but 'should we invest in X?' Real questions have answers that lead to decisions.

Access to data: Sounds obvious, but I've seen capstones fail because the promised data never materialized. Before you commit, see the data.

Engaged sponsor: Someone who will give you feedback, answer questions, and validate that your findings make sense. A sponsor who's 'too busy' is a red flag.

Feasible scope: You have limited time. A project that could take 6 months isn't a capstone; it's a full-time job. Scope it down.

Demonstrable impact: Can you show what you did mattered? If the analysis sits on a shelf, it's hard to talk about in interviews.

Warning signs: vague questions, unavailable data, absent sponsors. These are predictors of failed capstones."

**Transition:** "Let me say more about the sponsor relationship..."
-->

---

## Capstone Scope: Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Too broad** | "Optimize all marketing" → Never finishes |
| **Too narrow** | "Fix this one bug" → Not substantial enough |
| **No data access** | Promised data never materializes |
| **No decision-maker** | Analysis complete, nobody acts on it |
| **Dependent on others** | Blocked waiting for engineering/legal/etc. |

**The Brief forces you to address these before starting.**

---

## The Sponsor Relationship

Your sponsor is your primary stakeholder. They:
- Define the business problem
- Provide access to data
- Give feedback on approach
- Validate findings make sense

**Ideal sponsor:** Someone with a real question AND time to engage.

**Warning:** A sponsor who's "too busy" = no feedback = bad capstone.

# Part 2: Finding & Securing Projects
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The October Principle

> **You should have started looking for capstone projects in October.**

If you haven't started yet, **start today.**

Why early matters:
- Good projects get claimed
- Building relationships takes time
- Data access takes time
- Scope negotiation takes time

March 16 is your assignment deadline. That's 9 weeks away.

---

## Where to Find Projects

- **Your employer** — Know the data (but may be narrow)
- **CEU network** — Curated, committed sponsors (competitive)
- **Personal network** — Relationship exists (quality varies)
- **Cold outreach** — Unlimited options (low response)
- **Nonprofits/NGOs** — Meaningful work (less data sophistication)

**Best approach:** Multiple channels simultaneously.

---

## Network Activation

Most projects come through relationships. Activate your network:

1. **LinkedIn post** — "Looking for analytics capstone project for [school/program]"
2. **Email to contacts** — Personal ask to former colleagues, managers
3. **Alumni network** — CEU alumni who've done capstones
4. **Professional groups** — Meetups, Slack communities

**The ask:** "Do you know anyone with a data question they'd like help with?"

---

## Evaluating a Potential Project

Before committing, ask:

| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|---------------|
| What's the business question? | They can't articulate it |
| What data is available? | "We'll figure it out" |
| Who will I work with? | No named sponsor |
| What decisions will this inform? | "Just curious" |
| What's the timeline for access? | More than 2 weeks |

**It's okay to say no.** A bad project is worse than waiting.

---

## Red Flags in Project Proposals

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| "We have tons of data, just explore" | No clear question |
| "We'll get you access soon" | Data may never come |
| "The CEO is very interested" | But never available |
| "This is a simple project" | Scope will creep |
| "We've tried this before" | Previous failures; why? |
| "It needs to be done by [soon]" | Not a capstone, it's free labor |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** These are actual phrases students have heard from potential sponsors. Each one sounds benign but predicts problems. Teaching students to recognize these early saves them from bad projects.

**Key point:** Learn the language of red flags. Trust your instincts when something feels off.

**Say something like:**
"Let me teach you the language of red flags. These are actual things sponsors have said to students.

'We have tons of data, just explore.' This means there's no clear question. Exploration without a question is a recipe for wasted time.

'We'll get you access soon.' This often means the data never comes. Before you commit, SEE the data.

'The CEO is very interested.' But the CEO is never available. Interest without availability isn't helpful.

'This is a simple project.' Simple projects creep. If they say it's simple, ask why they haven't done it themselves.

'We've tried this before.' Ask why it failed. You might be walking into the same problem.

'It needs to be done by [soon].' If it's urgent, it's not a capstone — it's free labor. Capstones have academic timelines.

When you hear these phrases, dig deeper or walk away."

**Transition:** "How do you negotiate scope when sponsors want too much?..."
-->

---

## Negotiating Scope with Sponsors

Sponsors often want **more** than is feasible.

**Your job:** Negotiate a scope that's:
- Valuable to them
- Feasible for you
- Demonstrable as a capstone

**How:**
- "What's the most important question?"
- "If we could only answer one thing, what would it be?"
- "What would you do with the answer?"

---

## The Scope Conversation

**Sponsor says:** "We want to optimize our entire customer journey."

**You say:** "That's a great long-term goal. For the capstone, what if we focused on [specific part]? We could do a funnel analysis on the checkout flow and identify the biggest drop-off points. Would that be valuable?"

**Key moves:**
- Acknowledge their big goal
- Propose a specific slice
- Check if it's valuable

---

## Exercise: Evaluate a Project

> **Scenario:** A startup founder says: "We have 6 months of user data. I want to know why users churn and how to fix it. I'm super busy but I can meet once a month. Data is in a CSV somewhere."

> **Think (2 min):** Would you take this project? What questions would you ask?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This exercise applies the red flags framework to a realistic scenario. Every phrase in the founder's pitch contains a warning sign. Students should practice recognizing these before they encounter them in real life.

**Key point:** Learn to hear the warning signs hidden in optimistic language.

**Say something like:**
"Here's a real scenario. A startup founder approaches you. Listen to what they say:

'We have 6 months of user data.' — Okay, that's something.

'I want to know why users churn and how to fix it.' — Broad. Very broad. 'Why users churn' could mean a hundred different analyses. And 'how to fix it' implies they want you to solve the problem, not just diagnose it.

'I'm super busy but I can meet once a month.' — Red flag. Once a month means no feedback loop. You'll do work, wait weeks for input, and maybe find out you went in the wrong direction.

'Data is in a CSV somewhere.' — Major red flag. 'Somewhere' means they don't know where it is, which means they haven't looked at it, which means they don't know if it's usable.

Take 2 minutes. Would you take this project? What questions would you ask before deciding?"

**Facilitation:** Give them 2 minutes to think. Then cold-call 2-3 students.

**Strong answers to look for:**
- "I'd want to see the data before committing" — Correct. Never commit blind.
- "I'd ask who else I can contact for feedback" — Good. If the founder is busy, who's my day-to-day contact?
- "I'd ask what specific decision this informs" — Excellent. 'Why users churn' isn't actionable. 'Should we change onboarding or pricing?' is.
- "I'd scope it down to one question" — Great. Turn 'why users churn' into 'what's the primary driver of D30 churn?'

**Weak answers to push back on:**
- "I'd take it because startups are exciting" — Excitement doesn't make up for bad project structure.
- "I'd figure it out as I go" — That's how capstones fail.

**Transition:** "Now let me tell you about your assignment..."

# Part 3: Your Assignment — Scenario → Brief
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The Assignment

**Due:** Thursday, January 16, 2026, 23:59 CET

**What you'll receive:** A unique 2-page business scenario describing:
- A company and its situation
- A business problem
- Key stakeholders
- Available data
- Constraints

**What you'll submit:** A complete Analytics Project Brief for that scenario.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the first major assignment (30% of grade). Each student receives a unique scenario to prevent copying and force independent thinking. The deadline is Thursday evening, giving students 4 days to complete it.

**Key point:** Unique scenarios mean you can't collaborate on answers. You can discuss approaches but not share your Brief.

**Say something like:**
"Let me tell you about your assignment.

Due Thursday, January 16 at 23:59 CET. That's four days from now.

You'll each receive a unique 2-page business scenario. Different company, different problem, different constraints. This is intentional — it prevents copying and forces you to think independently.

The scenario will give you everything you need: the company situation, the business problem, key stakeholders, available data, and constraints. Your job is to write a complete Analytics Project Brief for that scenario.

You'll receive your scenario via email after class today. If you don't receive it by tonight, email me."

**If asked:** "Can we work together?"
A: You can discuss the Brief framework and general approaches. You cannot share your scenario or your Brief sections. Each scenario is unique to you.

**Transition:** "Why unique scenarios?..."
-->

---

## Why Unique Scenarios?

Each student receives a **different scenario**.

This is intentional:
- Prevents copying
- Forces independent thinking
- Creates variety for class discussion
- Mirrors real-world (you don't get the same problem as a colleague)

Your scenario will be distributed via email after class today.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Students often want to collaborate, especially on challenging assignments. This slide explains why unique scenarios are essential. The key is framing it positively (forces independent thinking, mirrors reality) rather than punitively (prevents cheating).

**Key point:** Unique scenarios aren't about distrust — they're about developing individual judgment that you'll need in your career.

**Say something like:**
"Each of you will receive a different scenario. This is intentional, and let me explain why.

First, it prevents copying. That's the obvious one. But that's not the main reason.

The main reason is this: it forces independent thinking. In your career, you won't have a classmate with the same problem. You'll have to scope projects yourself, make judgment calls yourself, identify blockers yourself. This assignment simulates that.

It also creates variety for class discussion. When we review these in the exam or in office hours, we can discuss different approaches to different problems. That's more valuable than everyone having the same answer.

And it mirrors reality. Your colleague doesn't get the same project as you. You can discuss frameworks and approaches — that's valuable — but you can't copy their scoping document. Same here."

**If asked:** "Can we work together?"
A: You can discuss the Brief framework. You can ask each other 'how do you think about counter-metrics?' You cannot share your specific scenario or your specific Brief sections. Think of it like studying together for an exam — you can quiz each other on concepts, but you can't share your answers during the test.

**If asked:** "What if we accidentally got the same scenario?"
A: You won't. Each scenario is generated uniquely. If you think you received the same one as someone else, email me immediately — it would be a system error.

**Transition:** "Let me show you what excellent looks like..."
-->

---

## What Makes an Excellent Submission?

**Metrics** — Precise SQL-level definition, not "conversion rate"

**Counter-metrics** — Specific, with guardrail/tradeoff labeled

**Stakeholders** — Named blockers with motivation, not "leadership"

**Methodology** — Justified analysis selection, not "we'll look at the data"

**Pre-mortem** — Specific failure scenario, not generic

---

## Metric Definition Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Primary metric: User engagement

✅ **Excellent:**
> Primary metric: D7 Active Users — Users with ≥1 `session_start` event on calendar day 7 after `signup_complete` event on day 0, excluding users flagged as `bot=true`, trailing 7-day rolling average

**The test:** Could someone write the SQL from your definition?

---

## Counter-Metric Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Counter-metric: Revenue

✅ **Excellent:**
> Counter-metric: Revenue per User (Guardrail)
> - Definition: `total_revenue` / `active_users`, monthly
> - Why it could break: Aggressive conversion tactics may bring in low-value users
> - How we'll measure: Monitor RPU trend during and after intervention
> - Threshold: Must not decline >5% from baseline

---

## Stakeholder Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Stakeholders: Product team, executives

✅ **Excellent:**
> **Blocker:** Head of Growth
> - Motivation: Their team built the current onboarding flow; findings may imply their work failed
> - Current status: Recently promoted based on "successful" launch metrics
> - Mitigation: Private pre-brief, frame as "learning opportunity," acknowledge what worked before discussing what didn't

---

## Pre-Mortem Example

❌ **Weak:** "The project failed because we didn't have good data."

✅ **Excellent:** "Tutorial completers retain 2x better → mandated tutorial → signup dropped 40%. We confused correlation with causation. Should have A/B tested shorter tutorial."

---

## Grading Rubric Preview

| Section | Pts | Section | Pts |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Problem & Decision | 10 | Scope & Success | 10 |
| Metrics | 15 | Risks & Pre-Mortem | 15 |
| Stakeholders | 15 | Overall coherence | 20 |
| Methodology | 15 | | |

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** The rubric shows where points are allocated. Metrics, Stakeholders, and Pre-Mortem are weighted heavily because these are where students typically struggle most. Overall Coherence (20 pts) is the largest single category — this is where most points are lost.

**Key point:** Coherence matters most. Sections must connect, not stand alone.

**Say something like:**
"Here's how the assignment is graded. Notice the distribution.

Problem & Decision: 10 points. This should be the easiest section.

Metrics: 15 points. SQL-level precision matters. 'Conversion rate' with no definition will lose points.

Stakeholders: 15 points. Named blockers with motivations, not 'leadership.'

Methodology: 15 points. Justified analysis selection, not 'we'll look at the data.'

Scope & Success: 10 points. Clear in/out scope, decision criteria.

Risks & Pre-Mortem: 15 points. Specific failure scenarios, not generic.

And the big one: Overall Coherence. 20 points. This is where most points are lost. Your sections need to connect. The methodology must answer the problem. The counter-metrics must anticipate the pre-mortem. If your sections feel like independent documents, you'll lose points here."

**Transition:** "Let me explain what coherence means..."
-->

---

## Overall Coherence (20 points)

This is where most points are lost. Two parts:

**Internal Consistency (10 pts):**
- Do your metrics align with your methodology?
- Does your pre-mortem connect to your risks and stakeholders?
- Do decision criteria match your problem statement?
- Does scope match the timeline and data you have?

**Professional Quality (10 pts):**
- Clear, concise writing
- Would you present this to a real sponsor?
- No contradictions between sections

---

## Process Recommendation

1. **Read the scenario twice** — First for overview, second for details
2. **Identify the core decision** — What will this analysis inform?
3. **Draft the metric first** — Forces precision early
4. **Work through stakeholders** — Who might block? Why?
5. **Select methodology** — Which 2-3 analyses apply?
6. **Write the pre-mortem last** — After you understand the full picture

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This sequence matters. Students often jump straight to methodology ("I'll do a funnel analysis!") without understanding the decision context. Or they write the pre-mortem first and it's too generic. This order forces precision at each stage.

**Key point:** The order isn't arbitrary — each step informs the next. Shortcuts create incoherent Briefs.

**Say something like:**
"Let me explain why this order matters.

Read the scenario twice. First time for the overall situation — what's the company, what's the problem, what are the constraints. Second time for the details — the specific data available, the stakeholder dynamics, the timeline.

Identify the core decision first. Before you pick metrics or analyses, ask: what decision will this inform? 'Should we shift budget?' 'Should we change the onboarding flow?' If you can't state the decision, you're not ready to write the Brief.

Draft the metric first. This forces precision early. 'Conversion rate' is vague. 'Users who complete checkout within 7 days of first session' is precise. Getting this right early makes everything else easier.

Work through stakeholders next. Who cares about this decision? Who might block it? Why? This is where you identify the politics before you run the analysis.

Select methodology after you understand the context. Not before. If you jump to 'I'll do a cohort analysis' before understanding the decision, you might pick the wrong analysis.

Write the pre-mortem last. Why? Because it's a failure story about THIS project. If you don't understand your metrics, stakeholders, and methodology, your pre-mortem will be generic. 'The data was bad.' That's not useful. A good pre-mortem is specific to what could go wrong with YOUR approach."

**If asked:** "What if I want to do it in a different order?"
A: You can. But I've seen what happens when students skip steps or reorder them — the Brief sections don't connect, and that's where coherence points are lost. This order is a recommendation based on what works.

**Transition:** "Questions before we move on?..."
-->

---

## Questions About the Assignment?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Take 3-4 questions.
Common Qs:
- "How long should it be?" → Quality > length, but typically 3-5 pages
- "Can I use the template?" → Yes, it's designed for this
- "What if I don't know something?" → "Unknown/TBD" is honest; blank is not
-->

## What You've Learned

| Day 1 | Day 2 |
|-------|-------|
| The Analytics Project Brief | Application & practice |
| Counter-metrics & adversarial thinking | Influence strategies |
| 9 foundational analyses | Stakeholder communication |
| Stakeholder mapping | Capstone preparation |

**One framework, applied repeatedly.**

---

## The Core Messages

1. **"Fill out the Brief before you analyze."** — Not after. Not during. Before.

2. **"What breaks if you succeed?"** — Always identify counter-metrics.

3. **"Never surprise a stakeholder."** — Pre-brief uncomfortable findings.

4. **"Correlation ≠ causation."** — A/B test before mandating changes.

5. **"Your job is never to optimize a metric."** — Improve the experience it measures.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** These five messages are the course distilled to its essence. If students remember nothing else, these five principles will serve them throughout their careers.

**Key point:** Five principles that will guide your work for years.

**Say something like:**
"If you remember nothing else from this course, remember these five things.

One: Fill out the Brief before you analyze. Not after. Not during. Before. 30 minutes of scoping saves 30 hours of wrong analysis.

Two: What breaks if you succeed? Always identify counter-metrics. Optimization without guardrails is dangerous.

Three: Never surprise a stakeholder. Pre-brief uncomfortable findings. The meeting should be confirmation, not revelation.

Four: Correlation is not causation. Before you recommend forcing a behavior on users, A/B test it. Tutorial completers retain better, but mandating tutorials might not improve retention.

Five: Your job is never to optimize a metric. Your job is to improve the experience that the metric measures. The metric is a proxy. Don't optimize the proxy at the expense of reality.

These five principles will guide your work for years. Write them down."

**Transition:** "And here's why each tool we taught you matters..."
-->

---

## What Each Piece Prevents

| Tool | Prevents |
|------|----------|
| **The Brief** | Analysis nobody acts on |
| **Counter-metrics** | Decisions that backfire |
| **Stakeholder mapping** | Decisions that get blocked |
| **Pre-mortem** | Failures you could have seen coming |

Every tool exists to make sure your work **drives a decision**.

---

## Final Thoughts

The technical skills will evolve. Python libraries change. New tools emerge.

But the **discipline of scoping projects well** is durable.

In 10 years:
- You may not remember SQL syntax
- You will remember to ask "what breaks if we succeed?"
- You will remember to identify blockers before presenting
- You will remember to scope before analyzing

**That's what this course is for.**

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the emotional close of the course. Students have absorbed a lot of content over two days. This slide is about durable value — the distinction between technical skills that depreciate and professional habits that compound. The goal is for students to feel that what they learned will matter throughout their careers, not just for the capstone.

**Key point:** Technical skills change. The discipline of scoping well is forever.

**Say something like:**
"I want to close with something that I hope you'll remember years from now.

The technical skills you've learned — and will continue to learn — will evolve. The Python library you master this year might be deprecated in five years. The SQL syntax you memorize will be replaced by something else. The hot analytical framework of today will be the legacy system of tomorrow.

That's fine. That's how technology works. You'll adapt.

But the discipline of scoping projects well? That's durable. In 10 years, you might not remember the syntax for a cohort retention query. But you WILL remember to ask 'what breaks if we succeed?' You WILL remember to identify blockers before you present uncomfortable findings. You WILL remember that 30 minutes of scoping saves 30 hours of wrong analysis.

That's what this course is for. Not to teach you tools that will change. To teach you habits that will compound.

The Brief framework is just a structure. The real skill is the discipline: don't start analyzing until you've done the hard work of alignment. That discipline will serve you whether you're a junior analyst or a VP. Whether you're in tech or healthcare or finance. Whether analytics looks like Python or something that doesn't exist yet.

[Pause]

I hope you carry that with you."

**If asked:** [unlikely at this moment]

**Transition:** "Any final questions?"
-->

---

## Questions?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** Final Q&A before the course ends. This is the last chance for students to clarify anything. If there are no questions, use the reflection prompt.

**Key point:** End with reflection if no questions.

**Facilitation:**
Take final questions. If none after 15 seconds:

"What's one thing you'll do differently in your next analytics project?"

Cold call 2-3 students. Listen to their answers. Affirm good ones.

This creates closure and reinforces learning through verbalization.

# Good luck with your capstones!

**Your job is to drive better decisions with data.**

Fill out the Brief before you analyze.
Ask "what breaks?" before you recommend.
Never surprise a stakeholder.

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:

**Background:** This is the final slide. It should stay on screen as students leave. The three principles are the course in three lines.

**Key point:** Leave the room with these principles visible.

**Say something like:**
"Your job is to drive better decisions with data. That's what analytics is for.

Three things to remember:
Fill out the Brief before you analyze.
Ask 'what breaks?' before you recommend.
Never surprise a stakeholder.

Thank you. Good luck with your capstones. I'll see your Briefs on Thursday."

[Wait for applause if appropriate, otherwise dismiss]
