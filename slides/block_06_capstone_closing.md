# Designing Analytics Projects

## Block 6: Capstone Preparation & Closing

**Eduardo Arino de la Rubia**
January 12, 2026

---

## Block 6 Overview

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| Capstone Lifecycle Overview | 25 min |
| Finding & Securing Projects | 25 min |
| Your Assignment: Scenario → Brief | 25 min |
| Closing | 25 min |

---

## Why This Matters

Everything in this course points toward one thing:

**Your capstone project.**

This is the largest single deliverable in your program. It's what employers see. It's what you talk about in interviews.

The Analytics Project Brief is your tool to **scope it professionally**.

---

# Part 1: Capstone Lifecycle Overview
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The Capstone Timeline: Finding Phase

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| ~~Mid-October~~ | ~~Start looking for clients~~ |
| ~~Mid-November~~ | ~~Report potential projects~~ |
| **Dec – Feb** | Matchmaking ← **you are here** |
| **March 16** | Assigned to project |

---

## The Capstone Timeline: Execution Phase

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **March 30** | Submit PID |
| **April 10** | Project officially begins |
| **May 11** | Interim progress report |
| **June 8** | Final deliverables due |
| **June 10-12** | Final Exam |

**Key insight:** The hardest part isn't execution. It's finding and scoping.

---

## The Three Deliverables

**1. Project Presentation** (10-20 slides)
Problem, solution, and recommendations for your sponsor.

**2. Technical Discussion** (20-25 pages)
Complete consulting-style report with methodology details.

**3. Public Summary** (3 pages)
General audience essay for the ETD database.

All three require a **well-scoped project**. The Brief is your scoping tool.

---

## How the Brief Scaffolds Your Capstone

Each Brief section maps to a capstone question:

- **Problem & Decision** → What question are you answering?
- **Metrics** → How will you measure success?
- **Stakeholders** → Who is your sponsor?
- **Methodology** → What analyses will you run?
- **Scope** → What's in and out?

---

## Building Your Brief Over Time

**You'll practice Brief concepts through weekly write-ups (Feb 10 – Mar 17).**

First you'll practice concepts while searching for projects, then build Brief sections once assigned.

---

## What Makes a Good Capstone Project?

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Real business question** | Shows you can work on actual problems |
| **Access to data** | You can't analyze what you can't see |
| **Engaged sponsor** | Someone who cares about the answer |
| **Feasible scope** | Completable in the time available |
| **Demonstrable impact** | You can show what you did mattered |

**Warning signs:** Vague questions, unavailable data, absent sponsors.

---

## Capstone Scope: Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Too broad** | "Optimize all marketing" → Never finishes |
| **Too narrow** | "Fix this one bug" → Not substantial enough |
| **No data access** | Promised data never materializes |
| **No decision-maker** | Analysis complete, nobody acts on it |
| **Dependent on others** | Blocked waiting for engineering/legal/etc. |

**The Brief forces you to address these before starting.**

---

## The Sponsor Relationship

Your sponsor is your primary stakeholder. They:
- Define the business problem
- Provide access to data
- Give feedback on approach
- Validate findings make sense

**Ideal sponsor:** Someone with a real question AND time to engage.

**Warning:** A sponsor who's "too busy" = no feedback = bad capstone.

---

# Part 2: Finding & Securing Projects
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The October Principle

> **You should have started looking for capstone projects in October.**

If you haven't started yet, **start today.**

Why early matters:
- Good projects get claimed
- Building relationships takes time
- Data access takes time
- Scope negotiation takes time

March 16 is your assignment deadline. That's 9 weeks away.

---

## Where to Find Projects

- **Your employer** — Know the data (but may be narrow)
- **CEU network** — Curated, committed sponsors (competitive)
- **Personal network** — Relationship exists (quality varies)
- **Cold outreach** — Unlimited options (low response)
- **Nonprofits/NGOs** — Meaningful work (less data sophistication)

**Best approach:** Multiple channels simultaneously.

---

## Network Activation

Most projects come through relationships. Activate your network:

1. **LinkedIn post** — "Looking for analytics capstone project for [school/program]"
2. **Email to contacts** — Personal ask to former colleagues, managers
3. **Alumni network** — CEU alumni who've done capstones
4. **Professional groups** — Meetups, Slack communities

**The ask:** "Do you know anyone with a data question they'd like help with?"

---

## Evaluating a Potential Project

Before committing, ask:

| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|---------------|
| What's the business question? | They can't articulate it |
| What data is available? | "We'll figure it out" |
| Who will I work with? | No named sponsor |
| What decisions will this inform? | "Just curious" |
| What's the timeline for access? | More than 2 weeks |

**It's okay to say no.** A bad project is worse than waiting.

---

## Red Flags in Project Proposals

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| "We have tons of data, just explore" | No clear question |
| "We'll get you access soon" | Data may never come |
| "The CEO is very interested" | But never available |
| "This is a simple project" | Scope will creep |
| "We've tried this before" | Previous failures; why? |
| "It needs to be done by [soon]" | Not a capstone, it's free labor |

---

## Negotiating Scope with Sponsors

Sponsors often want **more** than is feasible.

**Your job:** Negotiate a scope that's:
- Valuable to them
- Feasible for you
- Demonstrable as a capstone

**How:**
- "What's the most important question?"
- "If we could only answer one thing, what would it be?"
- "What would you do with the answer?"

---

## The Scope Conversation

**Sponsor says:** "We want to optimize our entire customer journey."

**You say:** "That's a great long-term goal. For the capstone, what if we focused on [specific part]? We could do a funnel analysis on the checkout flow and identify the biggest drop-off points. Would that be valuable?"

**Key moves:**
- Acknowledge their big goal
- Propose a specific slice
- Check if it's valuable

---

## Exercise: Evaluate a Project

> **Scenario:** A startup founder says: "We have 6 months of user data. I want to know why users churn and how to fix it. I'm super busy but I can meet once a month. Data is in a CSV somewhere."

> **Think (2 min):** Would you take this project? What questions would you ask?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Red flags:
- "Somewhere" = data access uncertain
- "Once a month" = disengaged sponsor
- "Why users churn" = broad, needs scoping
- Startup = data quality may be poor

Questions to ask:
- Can I see the data before committing?
- Who else can I contact for feedback?
- What specific decisions will this inform?
-->

---

# Part 3: Your Assignment — Scenario → Brief
### *(25 minutes)*

---

## The Assignment

**Due:** Thursday, January 16, 2026, 23:59 CET

**What you'll receive:** A unique 2-page business scenario describing:
- A company and its situation
- A business problem
- Key stakeholders
- Available data
- Constraints

**What you'll submit:** A complete Analytics Project Brief for that scenario.

---

## Why Unique Scenarios?

Each student receives a **different scenario**.

This is intentional:
- Prevents copying
- Forces independent thinking
- Creates variety for class discussion
- Mirrors real-world (you don't get the same problem as a colleague)

Your scenario will be distributed via email after class today.

---

## What Makes an Excellent Submission?

**Metrics** — Precise SQL-level definition, not "conversion rate"

**Counter-metrics** — Specific, with guardrail/tradeoff labeled

**Stakeholders** — Named blockers with motivation, not "leadership"

**Methodology** — Justified analysis selection, not "we'll look at the data"

**Pre-mortem** — Specific failure scenario, not generic

---

## Metric Definition Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Primary metric: User engagement

✅ **Excellent:**
> Primary metric: D7 Active Users — Users with ≥1 `session_start` event on calendar day 7 after `signup_complete` event on day 0, excluding users flagged as `bot=true`, trailing 7-day rolling average

**The test:** Could someone write the SQL from your definition?

---

## Counter-Metric Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Counter-metric: Revenue

✅ **Excellent:**
> Counter-metric: Revenue per User (Guardrail)
> - Definition: `total_revenue` / `active_users`, monthly
> - Why it could break: Aggressive conversion tactics may bring in low-value users
> - How we'll measure: Monitor RPU trend during and after intervention
> - Threshold: Must not decline >5% from baseline

---

## Stakeholder Example

❌ **Weak:**
> Stakeholders: Product team, executives

✅ **Excellent:**
> **Blocker:** Head of Growth
> - Motivation: Their team built the current onboarding flow; findings may imply their work failed
> - Current status: Recently promoted based on "successful" launch metrics
> - Mitigation: Private pre-brief, frame as "learning opportunity," acknowledge what worked before discussing what didn't

---

## Pre-Mortem Example

❌ **Weak:** "The project failed because we didn't have good data."

✅ **Excellent:** "Tutorial completers retain 2x better → mandated tutorial → signup dropped 40%. We confused correlation with causation. Should have A/B tested shorter tutorial."

---

## Grading Rubric Preview

| Section | Pts | Section | Pts |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| Problem & Decision | 10 | Scope & Success | 10 |
| Metrics | 15 | Risks & Pre-Mortem | 15 |
| Stakeholders | 15 | Overall coherence | 20 |
| Methodology | 15 | | |

---

## Overall Coherence (20 points)

This is where most points are lost. Two parts:

**Internal Consistency (10 pts):**
- Do your metrics align with your methodology?
- Does your pre-mortem connect to your risks and stakeholders?
- Do decision criteria match your problem statement?
- Does scope match the timeline and data you have?

**Professional Quality (10 pts):**
- Clear, concise writing
- Would you present this to a real sponsor?
- No contradictions between sections

---

## Process Recommendation

1. **Read the scenario twice** — First for overview, second for details
2. **Identify the core decision** — What will this analysis inform?
3. **Draft the metric first** — Forces precision early
4. **Work through stakeholders** — Who might block? Why?
5. **Select methodology** — Which 2-3 analyses apply?
6. **Write the pre-mortem last** — After you understand the full picture

---

## Questions About the Assignment?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Take 3-4 questions.
Common Qs:
- "How long should it be?" → Quality > length, but typically 3-5 pages
- "Can I use the template?" → Yes, it's designed for this
- "What if I don't know something?" → "Unknown/TBD" is honest; blank is not
-->

> Week 4 (Mar 3): "Evaluate 1-2 potential capstone projects against the red flags checklist."

**By Week 6 (Mar 17):** You're ready for your capstone.

---

## The Exam: January 27

**Format:** 90 minutes, closed book, one A4 cheat sheet allowed

**Structure:**

| Part | Time | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| A | 30 min | Concepts — Definitions, Goodhart's Law, influence strategies |
| B | 15 min | Matching — Connect problems to appropriate analyses |
| C | 45 min | Applied — Complete Brief sections for a new scenario |

**Preparation:** Review the Brief framework, 9 analyses, counter-metrics, stakeholder mapping.

---

## Office Hours & Support

**Office hours:** By appointment (email to schedule)

**Email:** rubiae@ceu.edu (use clear subject line)

**Urgent matters:** earino@gmail.com

**Zoom interventions:** Available for strategic discussions about your capstone

---

## What You've Learned

| Day 1 | Day 2 |
|-------|-------|
| The Analytics Project Brief | Application & practice |
| Counter-metrics & adversarial thinking | Influence strategies |
| 9 foundational analyses | Stakeholder communication |
| Stakeholder mapping | Capstone preparation |

**One framework, applied repeatedly.**

---

## The Core Messages

1. **"Fill out the Brief before you analyze."** — Not after. Not during. Before.

2. **"What breaks if you succeed?"** — Always identify counter-metrics.

3. **"Never surprise a stakeholder."** — Pre-brief uncomfortable findings.

4. **"Correlation ≠ causation."** — A/B test before mandating changes.

5. **"Your job is never to optimize a metric."** — Improve the experience it measures.

---

## What Each Piece Prevents

| Tool | Prevents |
|------|----------|
| **The Brief** | Analysis nobody acts on |
| **Counter-metrics** | Decisions that backfire |
| **Stakeholder mapping** | Decisions that get blocked |
| **Pre-mortem** | Failures you could have seen coming |

Every tool exists to make sure your work **drives a decision**.

---

## Final Thoughts

The technical skills will evolve. Python libraries change. New tools emerge.

But the **discipline of scoping projects well** is durable.

In 10 years:
- You may not remember SQL syntax
- You will remember to ask "what breaks if we succeed?"
- You will remember to identify blockers before presenting
- You will remember to scope before analyzing

**That's what this course is for.**

---

## Questions?

<!--
INSTRUCTOR NOTE:
Take final questions.
If none: "What's one thing you'll do differently in your next analytics project?"
Cold call 2-3 students.
