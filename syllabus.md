## Course Description

**A practical framework for analytics projects that deliver business value, applied immediately to your capstone.**

Most analytics courses teach you *how* to analyze data. This course teaches you *how to design analytics projects that matter* — the work that happens before you write any code. You'll learn to ask: What decision will this analysis inform? What metric are we optimizing, and what breaks if we succeed? Who needs to buy in, and who might block us?

The course is built around a single artifact: the **Analytics Project Brief**. This framework forces clarity on problem definition, metrics, stakeholders, methodology, and success criteria before any analysis begins. You'll see it applied to nine foundational analyses that span the complete customer journey — from acquisition through retention to expansion. By the end of the course, you'll have the tools to scope your capstone project professionally.

**What makes this course different:**
- **Framework over theory**: One reusable tool (the Brief) applied repeatedly, not a survey of concepts
- **Adversarial thinking**: Counter-metrics, pre-mortems, and stakeholder blockers built into every project
- **Influence skills**: How to get buy-in and navigate organizational dynamics

The foundational analyses follow the business lifecycle:
- **Acquisition**: Funnel → Channel Attribution → Campaign Effectiveness → CAC/LTV
- **Retention**: Retention Analysis → Power User Analysis → Failure Analysis
- **Growth**: Expansion & Monetization → Ecosystem Analysis

---

## Learning Outcomes

By successfully completing this course, students will be able to:

1. **Use the Analytics Project Brief framework** to scope an analytics project before writing any code
2. **Identify counter-metrics and stakeholder dynamics** that determine whether a project succeeds or fails politically
3. **Recognize which foundational analyses** apply to different business questions across the customer journey
4. **Apply influence strategies** to gain buy-in from stakeholders at different organizational levels

---

## The Analytics Project Brief

The Brief is a structured framework with 10 sections:

| Section | Key Question |
|---------|--------------|
| 1. Problem & Decision | What decision will this analysis inform? Who decides? |
| 2. Metrics | What's the primary metric? What are the counter-metrics? |
| 3. Stakeholders | Who has power/interest? Who champions or blocks? |
| 4. Methodology | What analyses will we run? What data do we need? |
| 5. Scope & Deliverables | What's in and out of scope? What do we deliver? |
| 6. Success Criteria | What does analytical and business success look like? |
| 7. Timeline | What are the key milestones? |
| 8. Risks & Assumptions | What could go wrong? What are we assuming? |
| 9. Ethics & Privacy | Does this require PII? Any bias risks? |
| 10. Pre-Mortem | It's 3 months from now and this failed. What happened? |

The course repository contains a blank template and 9 worked examples — one for each foundational analysis.

### Scenario → Brief Assignment (30%)

Each student receives a unique 2-page business scenario describing a company, problem, stakeholders, and available data. You will complete a full Analytics Project Brief for that scenario.

**Due:** Thursday, January 16, 2026, 23:59 CET

**Grading:** Rubric assessing each Brief section. What matters:
- Metric definition precision (not just "conversion rate" — the full definition)
- Counter-metrics that reveal adversarial thinking
- Stakeholder analysis that identifies blockers and their motivations
- Pre-mortem that surfaces non-obvious risks

**Note:** Each student receives a different scenario. This is intentional.

### Pen & Paper Exam (30%)

**When:** Tuesday, January 27, 2026
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Format:** Closed book, one A4 cheat sheet (handwritten or typed) allowed

**Structure:**
- **Part A (30 min):** Concepts — definitions, Goodhart's Law, influence strategies
- **Part B (15 min):** Matching — connect business problems to appropriate foundational analyses
- **Part C (45 min):** Applied — given a new scenario, complete specific Brief sections

### Weekly Write-ups (30%)

You'll submit 6 weekly write-ups from February 10 through March 17. These are practice exercises that prepare you for your capstone. Your actual capstone Brief is built through the PID process (due March 30).

| Week | Due Date | Topic |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Feb 10 | Capstone Search Kickoff |
| 2 | Feb 17 | Counter-Metrics in the Wild |
| 3 | Feb 24 | Analysis Methodology Selection |
| 4 | Mar 3 | Evaluating Project Opportunities |
| 5 | Mar 10 | Pre-Mortem on a Hypothetical |
| 6 | Mar 17 | Capstone Readiness Check |

**Grading:** Pass/fail per submission. Genuine engagement matters, not perfection.

**Sample prompts:**
- Week 2 (Feb 17): "Find an article about metric optimization gone wrong. Apply the 'What Breaks' framework."
- Week 4 (Mar 3): "Evaluate 1-2 potential capstone projects against the red flags checklist."

### Participation (10%)

- Active engagement in discussions
- Quality contributions during exercises
- Constructive peer feedback

## Policies

### Contacting the Instructor

Email (rubiae@ceu.edu) is the best way to reach me. Use a clear subject line identifying this course. State your question or request explicitly. For urgent matters: earino@gmail.com.

### Attendance

This is a 2-day intensive. Your learning — and your classmates' learning — depends on full presence. If you must miss a block, contact the instructor immediately. Missing multiple blocks will make successful completion very difficult.

### Academic Integrity

Struggling is acceptable. Asking for help is encouraged. Cheating is not negotiable.

A poor grade is a skill problem we can work on together. Cheating turns it into a trust problem that will be pursued under CEU's academic integrity policies.

### AI Usage

You **may** use AI tools to:
- Brainstorm ideas and risks
- Generate code you fully understand
- Draft text you then revise

You **must**:
- Add an "AI Usage" note describing what tools you used and how
- Verify all outputs yourself

You **may not**:
- Submit unedited AI-generated work as your own

### Accessibility

If you need accommodations, contact Student Support Services and the instructor before the course begins. We're committed to supporting your success.
